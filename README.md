Experimental contract project (Bills of Lading) for a CAT equipment reseller

This is a bill of lading forms uploader that ran as a webapp on any given mobile device.
It was created experimentally for a franchise manager as a proof-of-concept. Delivery was via email distribution lists.

The project was not adopted due to severe issues with the company's office365 email backend (email messages to 
certain recipients did not arrive sometimes for days).
